/**
 * A walking ground unit: a targeting component in slot 0, a movement component in slot 1 and the
 * entity state visit as its post-hook.
 *
 * <p>Because the holder runs one whole-list pass per slot, every character has chosen its target
 * for the tick before any character moves, and every character has moved before any character's
 * state visit runs. A character is created deploying and takes no decisions until its deploy
 * countdown, stepped by the state visit, runs out: its targeting component is not visited, and its
 * movement component is, but asks for no route and gets no speed, so only a push can move it.
 *
 * <p>Every state change - the lock the targeting visit requests, the resume, the state visit's
 * transitions - goes through the character's own {@link GridStateSetter}, so stopping empties the
 * route and resuming prepares one at once; taking a reference prepares its route through the same
 * setter, at the moment the reference is stored.
